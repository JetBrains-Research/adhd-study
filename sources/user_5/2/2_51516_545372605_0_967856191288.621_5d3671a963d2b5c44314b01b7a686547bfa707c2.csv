Please transform the following formula into a Pythonic function f(x,y,m.n). 
Note that there is no need or possibility to run the code. We won’t check if the code works, we only need to see your way of thinking:

$$f(x,y,m,n) = x - \prod_{n=0}^{100}{(\sqrt{18m} - 0.5*y^m)} $$ 
The $\prod_{n=0}^{100}$ symbol denotes the product of what is written in brackets with substituted values of n from 0 to 100.
